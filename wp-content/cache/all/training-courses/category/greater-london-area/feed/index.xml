]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Program Length &#8211; 8 hours*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Program Objectives:</strong> The purpose of this training is to provide employees with Forklift Truck operator safety training prescribed by legislation so they may obtain the ability to operate equipment in a safe, competent manner and work safely in their work environment and around other employees.</p>
<p>At the end of the training session, all participants who pass the training will receive a Class 1, 4, 5 Forklift certification (and wallet card) which is valid for 3 years to the date of issuance.</p>
<p><strong>Course Content:</strong><br />
This training will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding of the theory and principles involved in the safe operation of a forklift truck;</li>
<li>Know your legal responsibilities in forklift truck operation;</li>
<li>To recognize hazards associated with forklift truck operation and to recommend or suggest solutions; and</li>
<li>To verify practical knowledge of course content &amp; Skills Evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>This training program will certify participants in lifting classes 1, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>The program allows participants the opportunity to learn about topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industrial Truck Association (ITA) Classes</li>
<li>Components of forklifts</li>
<li>Understanding load capacity</li>
<li>Principles of forklift stability</li>
<li>Safe operation of forklifts</li>
<li>Refueling procedures (battery, propane, gas, diesel)</li>
<li>Provincial and Federal legislation</li>
<li>CSA Guidelines</li>
<li>Pre-operational inspections</li>
<li>Practical training (hands-on forklift operation)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who would benefit:</strong> Our forklift training program has been designed for those with an occupational requirement to be trained in and understand the safe operation of a forklift.</p>
<p><strong>Regulations and Guidelines:</strong> The program is designed to protect the health and safety of workers in the workplace and developed in accordance with the requirements of the OH&amp;S and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA).</p>
<p>All practical training at the Mentor Safety Training Centre will be completed using an electric (Class 1) sit-down, counterbalanced forklift. Although participants will learn about the steps involved in a propane tank exchange, a practical verification of knowledge will not be possible. Therefore, we highly recommend that site-specific training be offered on propane tank exchange for any participants who will be required to operate a propane-powered forklift.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All participants must wear CSA-approved safety shoes/boots and must provide a valid photo ID.</p>
<p>Group sessions can be booked both at our training location in London or at a remote location closer to you. <a title="Contact" href="https://mentorsafety.com/contact/">Contact Mentor Safety for details</a>.</p>
<p>*<em>Program length may vary depending on attendance</em></p>
